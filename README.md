# Credit-card-Risk-Assesment
Description -Credit risk assessment helps organizations know whether a borrower can pay back a loan.

Usage -Credit risk shows the likelihood of a lender losing their loaned money to a borrower. It sheds light on the ability of a borrower to pay back a loan or meet their contractual agreement. Conventionally, it deals with the risk every lender must be familiar with, which is losing the principal and interest owed. The aftermath of this is a disturbance to the lenderâ€™s cash flow and the possibility of losing more money in a bid to recover the loan.
